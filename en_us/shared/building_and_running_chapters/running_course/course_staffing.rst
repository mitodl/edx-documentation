Staffing
##########################

You can designate a team of people to help you run your course. Two roles are
available to give team members access to additional options for working with
students, grades, and other members of the staff.

* Staff

* Admin

You can assign these privileged roles when you work in either the LMS or
Studio. The people who have these roles can work on your course in Studio, the
LMS, and Insights. For more information about assigning roles to team members
in Studio, see :ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course or to moderate
and manage its discussions by assigning other roles in the LMS. Beta testers
and discussion team members must be enrolled in your course, but they do not
need to have the Staff or Admin role. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

****************************
Administrative Team Roles
****************************

To provide access to features on the LMS Instructor Dashboard, you assign the
Staff role or the Admin role.

Team members with the **Staff** role can complete these tasks.

* View the course before the Course Start Date. 

* Enroll and unenroll students.

* Access student grades.

* Reset student attempts to answer a question correctly.

* See course HTML errors.

* Send email messages to course participants.

Team members with the **Admin** role have access to all of the same options for
running the course as team members with the Staff role. They can also complete
these tasks.

* Add and remove Staff.

* Add and remove other Admins.

* Add and remove Beta Testers.

* Add and remove Discussion Admins, Discussion Moderators, and Discussion
  Community TAs.

  .. note:: To moderate course discussions, team members must have one 
   of these discussion roles assigned to them *in addition to* the Staff or
   Admin role. For more information, see :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
