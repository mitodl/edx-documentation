Writing Concept Topics
########################

Concept topics answer "Why?" and What is...?" questions. Concept topics build
on existing audience knowledge to provide general explanations, background
information, and examples to help the reader understand a feature or task.

Concept topics explain abstract ideas and introduce terminology. Concept
topics tend to be relatively unaffected by feature enhancements over time:
while additions might be needed to support new options and their use cases,
they tend to require less rewriting than task topics.

Concept topics are typically followed by at least one task topic. When they
introduce complex features, they are followed by a set of additional concept
topics and related task topics.

******************************

Example Concept Topics
******************************

The `Building and Running an edX Course`_ guide contains these examples of
concept topics.

* `Using Cohorts in Your Courses`_ introduces a complex topic. It includes
  several subsections to divide the concept into different facets. A list of
  related tasks is included at the beginning to redirect readers who might not
  need this background information.

* `Develop a Positive Discussion Culture`_ uses examples to define the concept
  of a positive discussion culture, and then offers a concrete example of
  actions to take for each one. This topic also provides a link to a related
  template.

* `Using the Course Wiki`_ introduces a section of related concepts and tasks.
  It defines a wiki in the context of an edX course, and provides example
  uses.

The `Processing Video Files`_ guide contains these examples.

* `Video Processing Overview`_ introduces the entire guide. It describes the
  purpose, and value, of the video pipeline to course teams and media
  specialists at edX member partner organizations.

* `Add a Transcript`_ introduces a series of tasks.
