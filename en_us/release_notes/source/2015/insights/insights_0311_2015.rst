In edX Insights, course teams can now review how students are answering graded
problems. You can use the performance charts and reports to assess problem
difficulty, identify common mistakes and misconceptions, and verify that your
problems are clearly stated and complete.

For more information, see `Student Performance`_ in the *Using edX Insights*
guide.
