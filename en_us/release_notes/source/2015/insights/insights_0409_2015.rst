Course teams can now use edX Insights to access student performance data for
both graded and ungraded exercises. The number of students who submitted an
answer, and the percentage who submitted the correct or incorrect answer, is
available at the section, subsection, and unit level. The actual answers that
students submit for each ungraded question are also available for review.

For more information, see the new `Ungraded Problem Submissions`_ section in
the *Using edX Insights* guide.
