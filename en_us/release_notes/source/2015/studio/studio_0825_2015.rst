You can now configure the following problem types so that learners can receive
partial credit for a problem if they submit an answer that is partly correct.

* Checkbox
* Dropdown
* Multiple Choice
* Numerical Input

By awarding partial credit for problems, you can motivate learners who have
mastered some of the course content and provide a score that reflects their progress.

For more information about configuring partial credit, see `Awarding Partial
Credit for a Problem`_ or `Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem - Open edX`_.
