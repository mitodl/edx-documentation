The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of
October 23, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

****************************************
edX Release Announcements Mailing List

These edX Course Staff Release Notes are always available and are updated with
each release of the edX Platform on `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_.

You can also sign up for the `edX Release Announcements mailing list`_ to get
an email message when we update the edX Course Staff Release Notes.

*******************************
edX Website
*******************************

Visitors to the `edx.org`_ website can now search for courses by name, school,
or subject. Search results can be further refined by selecting course
availability (for example, Current, Starting Soon, Archived) and type (for
example, Verified, High School, Professional Education).

*******************************
edX Course Discussion
*******************************

* When you enter a search term on the **Discussion** page, the search starts
  either when you click the magnifying glass icon or press the Enter key.
  Previously, only use of the Enter key started the search. (TNL-526)

* After you mark a response to a question post as the correct answer, a message
  that describes this action is added to the response. The hyperlinked username
  in this message now correctly opens a new page showing your contributions to
  the course discussion. (TNL-188)

*************

* The protein builder tool now correctly uses font sizing set by user browser
  preferences. (TNL-256)

  event was renamed. The ``event`` member field is now named ``child_id``
  instead of ``child-id``.
